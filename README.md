# Duke Personal Assistant
This application helps Duke students easily keep track of impending deadlines, class, on/off campus events, or even non-academic obligations. The beauty of Duke Personal Assistant is that each feature is integrated with one another to make for a seamless and cohesive experience. Whether the user wants to simply keep track of class meetings and assignments or needs to maintain an extensive schedule of events and tasks, Duke Personal Assistant eases the organizational burden of keeping up with academic/non-academic obligations by consolidating information that would normally exist across a variety of platforms.

## Key Features/Functionality
1) A page displaying all courses that the user is enrolled in (supports adding/removing courses by specific section)
2) A calendar displaying the user's courses and events for the week (supports adding new events for a given start/end time/date, updating/removing events)
3) A tasks/todo list that allows users to keep track of impending deadlines, assignment due dates, and even general errands in a clean display organized by category (ie. for a specific course, or even a custom category that persists for future tasks)

## Possible Extensions (if time permits)
1) Support notifications for tasks' pressing deadlines
2) Include map and integration with class/event/task locations to allow for navigation to on/off campus locations

- Core Data to store user's favorited course sections and schedules
